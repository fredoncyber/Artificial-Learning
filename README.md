# 🌐 Why AI Should Be Called Artificial Learning (AL)

> **“Machines don’t think — they learn.”**  
> *A conceptual and ethical reframing of what we currently call Artificial Intelligence.*

## 📘 Overview

This repository hosts the research paper and discussion materials for  
**“Why AI Should Be Called Artificial Learning (AL)”** — a project by **Fred Ofori** exploring why the term *Artificial Intelligence (AI)* misrepresents the actual function of modern computational systems.

The paper argues that today’s so-called *AI* models are fundamentally **learning systems**, not *thinking systems*.  
They lack reasoning, comprehension, and awareness — operating through **pattern recognition and probabilistic learning** rather than true intelligence.  

Hence, the proposed reclassification: **Artificial Learning (AL).**

## 🧩 Key Ideas

- **Intelligence ≠ Learning:** Intelligence implies understanding and reasoning. Learning implies pattern recognition and adaptation.  
- **Machines Learn, Humans Think:** AI models generalize data — they do not comprehend it.  
- **Reframing for Clarity:** “Artificial Learning” (AL) better captures what systems like ChatGPT, image classifiers, and reinforcement agents actually *do*.  
- **Ethical Implications:** Correct terminology promotes transparency, accountability, and realistic expectations of technology.

## 🧠 Abstract

> This paper challenges the conventional term *Artificial Intelligence* (AI) and proposes the adoption of *Artificial Learning* (AL) as a more accurate descriptor of modern computational systems.  
> It argues that AI models exhibit exceptional learning capacity without demonstrating true reasoning or understanding.  
> The AL framework provides a more precise, ethically sound, and scientifically grounded terminology for the field.

## 🧭 Vision Statement

The *Artificial Learning Initiative* is an ongoing effort to re-examine how society defines and governs machine cognition.  
By focusing on **learning** instead of **intelligence**, we can build technologies that are transparent, explainable, and ethically aligned with human values.
